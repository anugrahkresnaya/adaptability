                        All this time, I have always learned to code such as machine learning and web development. 
                        When I learned about machine learning, I had a problem with the way I learn that such as forgetting how to use a math formula, 
                        not mastering basic machine learning, 
                        too rushing lesson materials that made me feel like I learned at the wrong course platform even though it’s not, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this point, I know that I have a problem with the way of learning because I can’t focus at all. 
                        I had so many distractions when I study. for example, when I’m stuck at my coding, 
                        I’m definitely looking for a way to solve my code. if I couldn’t find anything to solve it for like 10 minutes, 
                        I’ll probably feel bored or stressed, so I will open Youtube or Netflix to relieve it. 
                        And sometimes because of that, I lose track of time. I’m still looking for a solution to fix it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Right now, I have a few strategies to overcome these problems.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Listen to music when you work</li>
                        <p>
                            I read some articles that said unpleasant ambient noise increases the production of cortisol. 
                            This is the hormone that manifests itself as stress in the human psyche. What’s more, 
                            cortisol reduces focus and increases aggression, which makes it unsuitable for high-focus tasks such as coding.
                            One of the best methods to remove any auditory distractions is to listen to music. 
                            There are lots of focus-based playlists and mixes on YouTube spread across various genres and styles. 
                            Find out what works for me and stick to it.
                            For example, I used lo-fi music as the background music, 
                            it will reinforce my feedback loop and keep me in the code for a long time.
                        </p>
                        <li>Run a timer</li>
                        <p>
                            For especially difficult tasks or ones I just don’t want to do, I just start a timer. 
                            Once I’ve been doing it for at least 10 minutes or 15minutes, then usually I will take a break, 
                            and I will put timer again so I won’t lose my time. This tip works for me sometimes.
                        </p>
                        <li>Take a walk</li>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the surefire methods to get you back into coding when your brain feels fried. 
                            If there is an accessible gym nearby, it is best to go for a run. 
                            Physical activity supports the secretion of serotonin, 
                            the happy hormone that revitalizes the mind. Even if it is not regular, 
                            a quick walk can be used as a tool to wake your mind up when you’re done with staring at your screen.
                        </p>
                        <li>Seperate the code and life</li>
                        <p>
                            Mostly, coding is something that I do for study and in the future, 
                            coding will be something that I do for living. Because I’m still in college, 
                            I have a class in the morning until afternoon, so I code at night in order that I won’t be disturbed by class.
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        And besides any of that, I have to change my mindset to growth mindset. 
                        Right now, I've changed my mindset by applying the tips I mentioned above. 
                        I acknowledge my weakness and I try to fix it by using the tips that I mentioned earlier. 
                        I will try to find another strategy to solve my weakness if I can’t use the previous strategy.
